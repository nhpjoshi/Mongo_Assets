Development Of Prototype has completed

Impact

The prototype can demonstrate MongoDB's time series capabilities, which are useful for monitoring the high volume of data produced by DCFC (Direct Current Fast Charging) stations for EVs (Electric Vehicles). This can help infrastructure owners monitor energy consumption and dynamic pricing for EV charging.

Potential Future State

Currently, I am trying to build a real-time analytics dashboard for this use case. MongoDB's time series data internally works like a columnar database with significant compression, approximately 98% reduction in data size. Therefore, I am exploring it alongside Kafka and Power BI.
